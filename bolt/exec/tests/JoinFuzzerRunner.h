/// Join FuzzerRunner leverages JoinFuzzer and VectorFuzzer to
/// automatically generate and execute join tests. It works by:
///
///  1. Picking a random join type.
///  2. Generating a random set of input data (vector), with a variety of
///     encodings and data layouts.
///  3. Executing a variety of logically equivalent query plans and
///     asserting results are the same.
///  4. Rinse and repeat.
///
/// The common usage pattern is as following:
///
///  $ ./bolt_join_fuzzer_test --steps 10000
///
/// The important flags that control JoinFuzzer's behavior are:
///
///  --steps: how many iterations to run.
///  --duration_sec: alternatively, for how many seconds it should run (takes
///          precedence over --steps).
///  --seed: pass a deterministic seed to reproduce the behavior (each iteration
///          will print a seed as part of the logs).
///  --v=1: verbose logging; print a lot more details about the execution.
///  --batch_size: size of input vector batches generated.
///  --num_batches: number if input vector batches to generate.
///
/// e.g:
///
///  $ ./bolt_join_fuzzer_test \
///         --steps 10000 \
///         --seed 123 \
///         --v=1
